Greetings! I'm Dhainik Suthar, and I'm delighted to have you visit my GitHub profile. I'm based in Ahmedabad, India, and my journey here revolves around the exciting realms of Data Engineering, Data Science, and Machine Learning. With a relentless passion for all things data, I've cultivated a robust skill set that encompasses database optimization, SQL expertise, and the creation of predictive models.

I possess a strong foundation in mathematics, encompassing statistics, probability, linear algebra, and calculus, which underpin my proficiency in Python and its libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. My expertise extends to exploratory data analysis, natural language processing, fine-tuning pre-trained YOLO models, and Power BI for data visualization. In the realm of machine learning, I'm well-versed in various models including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, AdaBoost, K-means, dimensionality reduction, SVM, and naive Bayes. Additionally, my deep learning skills encompass artificial neural networks, perceptrons, and convolutional neural networks. I'm also proficient in managing databases, particularly PostgreSQL and MS SQL Server, focusing on performance tuning and query optimization.

I have 6 months of internship experience as a Data Engineer intern at Simform Solutions where I Developed proficiency in writing complex queries, stored procedures, and optimizing databases and triggers. Optimized performance of queries and stored procedures in MS SQL Server, employing expert analysis of query plans, execution statistics, and server resources; achieved up to 60% reduction in query execution time and
increased overall system efficiency.
